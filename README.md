_Rush_ is a header only _C++20_ library that implements
mathematics solutions for graphic applications.
Specifically, _Rush_ was created to work together with
modern _OpenGL_ and _Vulkan_ applications, but it's
not limited to these technologies.

_Rush_ takes advantage of several _C++20_ features, such as
concepts, advanced template specifications or new _std_ features.

Currently, _Rush_ includes full support for vectors, matrices and
quaternions.
Future versions may include features such as noise, splines, advanced
data manipulation or diverse algorithms.
